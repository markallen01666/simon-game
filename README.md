# simon game

Summary: This is a solution to the Free Code Camp (FCC) advanced front-end development project task to create a computer game.

Resources: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, Javascript, jQuery.

Notes: This is one of the advanced challenges included in the FCC Front-End Web Developer certification course. The requirement was to build a web version of the Simon electronic game. The current version only displays accurately on large screens, so I'll be revisiting it when I have the time to create a responsive version.
